# Hello, Quarto!

This repository contains a small Quarto (`.qmd`) example that demonstrates how to combine:

- a static `ggplot2` figure  
- an interactive `plotly` figure  
- a simple `shiny` widget  

in a single HTML document.

The examples use the `palmerpenguins` dataset and show the relationship between flipper length and bill length.
