<p>Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <a href="https://quarto.org" class="uri">https://quarto.org</a>.</p>
<p>I use this document to test some of its features, specifically the ability to include R code that generates graphics and interactive widgets.</p>

<p>The <code>penguins</code> data from the <a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins" title="palmerpenguins R package">palmerpenguins</a> package contains size measurements for 344 penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. To demonstrate some graphics, I’ll gladly use this dataset.</p>
